# Python-API-Challenge- What's the Weather like?

## WeatherPy

In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ random (non-repeating) cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I have used a simple Python library- citipy- and the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across world cities and performing a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.

The objective of this exercise was to generate various scattered plots showing correlation between:
* [Latitude vs Temperature](#Latitude_vs_Temperature)
* [Latitude vs Humidity](#Latitude_vs_Humidity)
* [Latitude vs Cloudiness](#Latitude_vs_Cloudiness)
* [Latitude vs WindSpeed](#Latitude_vs_WindSpeed)



### Latitude_vs_Temperature
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="WeatherPy/Images/fig1.png" width=270></td>
  <tr>
<table>
* Above plot shows that temperatures are higher as you get closer to the equator. 

### Latitude_vs_Humidity
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="WeatherPy/Images/fig2.png" width=270></td>
  <tr>
<table>
* Above plot shows that humidity is relatively consistant across all latitudes. 
    
### Latitude_vs_Cloudiness
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="WeatherPy/Images/fig3.png" width=270></td>
  <tr>
<table>
* Above plot shows that cloudiness is relatively consistant across all latitudes.
    
### Latitude_vs_WindSpeed
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="WeatherPy/Images/fig4.png" width=270></td>
  <tr>
<table>
* Above plot shows that Wind Speed is somewhat indiffernt to the latitudes but if you notice that Wind Speed outliners all are at latitudes furthest from equator.
