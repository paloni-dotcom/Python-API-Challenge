# Python-API-Challenge- What's the Weather like?

## WeatherPy

In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ random (non-repeating) cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I have used a simple Python library- citipy- and the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across world cities and performing a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.

The objective of this exercise was to generate various scattered plots showing correlation between:
* [Latitude vs Temperature](#Latitude_vs_Temperature)
* [Latitude vs Humidity](#Latitude_vs_Humidity)
* [Latitude vs Cloudiness](#Latitude_vs_Cloudiness)
* [Latitude vs WindSpeed](#Latitude_vs_WindSpeed)



### Latitude_vs_Temperature
